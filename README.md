Here's a `README.md` template for your RPC (Remote Procedure Call) project:

# RPC Project in Ruby

This project demonstrates how to implement a simple RPC (Remote Procedure Call) server and client in Ruby. The server provides services that the client can invoke remotely, enabling communication between different systems or components.

## Requirements

- Ruby (version 3.x)
- Bundler (for managing gems)
- Required Gems (defined in the `Gemfile`)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rpc-ruby-project.git
cd rpc-ruby-project
```

### Install Dependencies

Install all the required gems using Bundler:

```bash
bundle install
```

This will install the necessary gems like `rpc`.

## Usage

### Start the RPC Server

To start the RPC server, run:

```bash
ruby server.rb
```

The server will listen for incoming RPC requests. By default, the server runs on `localhost` and a specified port (e.g., `4000`).

### RPC Client

To communicate with the server, use the client script:

```bash
ruby client.rb
```

The client sends RPC requests to the server and handles responses. Below is an example of how the client communicates with the server.

### Example: Calling a Remote Procedure

Assume we have a remote method `sum(a, b)` that adds two numbers on the server. 

1. **Server (`server.rb`)**:

```ruby
# server.rb
require 'rpc'

class RPCServer
  include RPC::Server

  # Define the sum method to be called remotely
  def sum(a, b)
    a + b
  end
end

server = RPCServer.new
server.start
```

2. **Client (`client.rb`)**:

```ruby
# client.rb
require 'rpc'

client = RPC::Client.new('http://localhost:4000')

# Call the remote sum method
result = client.call('sum', 5, 10)

puts "The result of the sum is: #{result}"
```

### Dependencies

- `rpc`: A Ruby gem for creating RPC servers and clients.
- `json`: For handling JSON data serialization.
- `net/http`: For handling HTTP connections.

## Troubleshooting

- **Issue: Server not starting**
    - Ensure that you have run `bundle install` and that the correct Ruby version is being used.
    - Check if the server port is already in use.

- **Issue: Missing gems**
    - Ensure that all required gems are listed in the `Gemfile`. Run `bundle install` to install them.
